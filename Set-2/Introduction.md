In this problem set you will practice designing a simulation and implementing a program that uses classes.

As with previous problem sets, please don't be discouraged by the apparent length of this assignment. There is quite a bit to read and understand, but most of the problems do not involve writing much code.

####GETTING STARTED

**Download and save**

[pset2.zip](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/e827b3b57c3cd2c6300f17b4d9453a04/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.2x_6+3T2016+type@asset+block/pset2.zip): A zip file of all the files you need, including:

* ps2.py, a skeleton of the solution.

* ps2_visualize.py, code to help you visualize the robot's movement (an optional - but cool! - part of this problem set).

* ps2_verify_movement35.pyc, precompiled module for Python 3.5 that assists with the visualization code.

####REVIEW OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING AND CLASSES

This and future problem sets will require you to know OOP. If you need a refresher, please visit these links and make sure you are familiar with these topics.

* Implementing [new classes and their attributes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap12.html).
* Understanding [class methods](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap14.html).
* Understanding [inheritance](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap16.html).
* Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class - recall that a class is a blueprint of an object, whilst an *instance* is a single, unique unit of a class.
* Utilizing libraries as black boxes.
